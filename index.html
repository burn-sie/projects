			Along time ago i was in the navy and thought to myself, "there has to be a better way to do some of the scheduling around here". <br />
			My first thought was Excel of course as it was the only thing i kinda really knew how to use. Then i thought, why create 
			something from scratch? I'm sure someone has thought of a way to do this already. So went ahead and searched the internet only to be
			left disappointed. I ran to the usual links everyone runs into, which i will post here hopefully will help people land on this page.

			Eventually i decided that i wasnt going to find anything useful on the net, so i created a large tool set of excel sheets to help in various ways,
			from planning, tracking when things were due, to inventory sheet. Here is the first of them.
			<br /><br />
			I created most of these tools from scratch on my own time and i adapted them to fit my needs then and they are still helpful in my needs now when i need something quick.
			I am posting them all here eventually in case they may be of used to yall.
			You can find the excel sheet on my personal GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/burn-sie/Scheduler">Here</a>
